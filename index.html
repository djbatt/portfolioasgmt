        <p class="text">Hi I'm Dave I like to spend my free time kayaking or hanging out at the river. I've lived in Richmond all my life, I actually grew up less than a mile from the river. My interest in computers and tech in general started with video games, I was introduced by my brother. I started out on flash games when I was very young but when I got older I got a Xbox for Christmas one year. Eventually I got a computer because there were more games on it. As I got older, I had learned so many things just by fixing things that broke when I tried to use a computer. I always wanted to make a career out of working on the computer but I never took the chance when I was younger. I want to make a career out of working on my computer by the end of this year.</p>
